It's good to have spent 70% on academics (since you're here to study), and 30% on non-academic matters (because life goes beyond lectures). It is best if you could spend your time doing positive activities and experiencing new things with a supportive community while you still can do it in the university, to maximize your learning. Joining student clubs of your interest and attending seminars that expands your knowledge would help that.

Intellectual stimulation, enrichment, meaningful engagement, personal fulfillment and overall satisfaction. Ideally, it provides opportunities for students to grow beyond the academic realm and harness whatever skill they have as well as expand their skill set. At the end of the day, students will most likely remember the things which felt the most fulfilling to them and this comes in the form of personal interactions with friends, bonds forged with professors and diversity beyond what we are used to before entering University. So although difficulties arise and times can be stressful, an ideal student life will ensure that there are plenty more sweet memories rather than bitter ones.

I learnt a great deal when I went on exchange because the grades given out are absolute, you are not graded one grade down just because you failed to get 87/100 and your 85/100 is not worthy of a B in the eyes of the system. The emphasis on grades and the bell curve system in University takes away the fun in learning I experienced on exchange. Since everyone gets an absolute score, the students are always ready to help one another out, discussions are less brutal about who is right and who is wrong but how we can all learn together. Overall, my life in University has only been made a little better through the different non-academic experiences I have been through. Would I recommend someone to study in University or head overseas? Definitely head overseas, I feel like right now, "ideal student life" is far from what we currently have.

Academic pursuits shouldn’t be the focus of a student and neither should the focus be on how good a student is in all aspects like academics and ccas and volunteering work and leadership. This does not foster a good learning environment for students, there’s always a motive behind doing something and it’s not driven by passion, like it’s for the sake of a resume. I’d like to be able to enjoy CCAs without affecting my studies. Bell curve is something that is undesired because it creates an environment where people are unwilling to help each other because when one person does poorer, you’ll perform relatively better. I think a bell curve and an expectation to be an all rounder is what makes student life rather toxic, not to mention people who don’t participate in group work (could be due to CCAs or other reasons they may provide).

I feel that for my course academics are ideally manageable, but when group work comes into play sometimes there are instances where one has to put in alot more hard work than someone else to bring a piece of work up to standard, without recognition nor reward, especially when the end grade is the same. This is rather unsettling, because this requires additional time on the part of the student which cannot be used for him or her to invest in other areas of growth that can help enhance his or her resume which could be very unfair. This is especially because academics are usually judged by CAP only, and leadership in these academic projects is generally not considered actual leadership in the eyes of employers. For top industries like consulting and investment banking where CAP is the first screening criteria, this can be a source of unfairness. Working on addressing this unfairness will go a long way to recognizing students and their hard work, rather than rewarding what appears to be highly individualistic and selfish behaviour which comes with a common score in group projects. This will allow all students to have an opportunity to pursue student life endeavours rather than be held back from enjoying student life activities by having to put in additional time and effort performing academic work for others who fall short of doing so.

We need to have more professors that inspire us to think further on our own rather than just teach the content and expect us to regurgitate them. We need to have a more wholesome learning experience in University, and that may mean restructuring certain Lecture and Tutorial scenarios. I personally find seminars more meaningful, as there is more discussion in the class rather than just listening and not speaking in Lecture and Tutorial format. I would like to see less academic results, and more of a learning experience.

At the same time, it is to play hard and engage in activities/causes that I am genuinely passionate about. I think that there is a common assumption that having fun in university means being very social in all the hall/camp/large-scale events, but those do not always work for everyone. Some people may be more introverted but equally passionate and happy pursuing their interests. I think an ideal student life, for me, is one where we respect that others may not have the same interests as us, and there should not be a benchmark for the "best" student life a student has to strive for. A student life should be balanced, and that balance is one that makes the student happy and fulfilled.

By that I don't necessarily mean through exchange or summer school, research trips, internship programmes, OCIP etc. are also possible. SMU is working on making overseas experiences compulsory. Perhaps our school life can be enhanced to allow our students to understand the global environment, interact more purposefully with foreigners and dream big. Good luck!

Makes me feel like I'm contributing or affecting lives in some way. When I get told what I can't do (due to people higher-up than me or school protocol/limitations), I would still try to understand their decisions, but it sucks. Since it feels as if everything is deterministic, and that I can't change anything. Then, what is the use of societies/groups when nothing can be done? That would be like "giving students a voice" but only when allowed to, which seems so counterintuitive and authoritative. Might as well just tell us to focus on academics instead of giving us a glimpse of what could be.
